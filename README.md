## ğŸ¤– AI Tweet Agent

This is the **first AI agent** Iâ€™ve ever built â€” and it **automatically posts tweets** using the power of **Google Gemini AI** and **X (Twitter) API**! Built during an amazing session by **Ankur Prajapati** at **Sheryians Coding School**.

### ğŸ§  What it does:
- Uses Googleâ€™s Gemini API to generate intelligent responses  
- Connects with Twitter/X API to post directly to your timeline  
- Supports secure configuration with `.env` and dotenv  
- Runs on Node.js using the official MCP (Model Context Protocol)

### ğŸš€ Tech Stack:
- Node.js  
- Google Gemini API  
- Twitter (X) API  
- dotenv  
- MCP SDK
